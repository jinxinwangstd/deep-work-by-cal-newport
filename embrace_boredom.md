# Embrace Boredom

The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.

Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, it is hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate.

This rule will help you significantly improve the limit of your concentration ability.

The training for the concentration ability must address two goals: improving your ability to concentrate intensely and overcoming your desire for distraction.

## Don't take breaks from distraction. Instead take breaks from focus.

This strategy is designed to help you rewire your brain to a configuration better suited to staying on task.

Once we see the distraction problem in terms of brain wiring, it becomes clear that an Internet Sabbath cannot by itself cure a distracted brain. Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction.

The strategy works as follows: Schedule in advance when you'll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times.

The idea motivating this strategy is that the use of a distracting service does not, by itself, reduce your brain's ability to focus. It is instead the constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty.

When putting it into practice, here are three important points to consider.

## Work like Teddy Roosevelt

This strategy asks you to inject the occasional dash of Rooseveltian intensity into your own workday. Estimate how long you would normally put aside for an obligation of a deep task, then give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time. If possible, commit publicly to the deadline. If this isn't possible, then motivate yourself by setting a countdown timer on your phone and propping it up where you cannot avoid seeing it as you work.

At this point, there should be only one possible way to get the deep task done in time: working with great intensity. Remember to always keep your self-imposed deadlines right at the edge of feasibility.
