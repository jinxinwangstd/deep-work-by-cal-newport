# Quit Social Media

Two categories of online distraction are social networks and infotainment sites.

The first point is that we increasingly recognize that these tools fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate.

The second point is the impotence with which knowledge workers currently discuss this problem of network tools and attention. The problem with this binary response to this issue is that these two choices are much too crude to be useful. 

We should accept that these tools are not inherently evil, and that some of them might be quite vital to your success and happiness, but at the same time also accept that the threshold for allowing a site regular access to your time and attention should be much more stringent, and that most people should therefore be using many fewer such tools.

Our first step toward finding this middle ground in network tool selection is to understand the current default decision process deployed by most Internet users.

The any-benefit approach to network tool selection: you're justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don't use it. 

The problem with this approach is that it ignores all the negatives that come along with the tools in question. Network tools are not exceptional; they are also tools. Throughout history, skilled laborers have applied sophistication and skepticism to their encounters with new tools and their decisions about whether to adopt them.

The craftsman approach to tool selection: identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.

I propose that if you're a knowledge worker, you should treat your tool selection with the same level of care as other skilled workers, such as farmers.

The three strategies that follow in this rule are designed to grow your comfort with abandoning the any-benefit mindset and instead applying the more thoughtful craftsman philosophy in curating the tools that lay claim to your time and attention.
